class rankine:
    """
    A class representing a Rankine cycle.

    This class models a Rankine cycle, which is a thermodynamic cycle commonly used in steam power plants.
    It calculates and stores the properties and efficiency of the Rankine cycle based on specified parameters.

    Attributes:
        p_low (float): The low-pressure value of the Rankine cycle.
        p_high (float): The high-pressure value of the Rankine cycle.
        t_high (float, optional): The high-temperature value of the Rankine cycle (if superheated).
            Defaults to None.
        name (str, optional): A useful identifier for the Rankine cycle instance. Defaults to 'Rankine Cycle'.
        efficiency (float): The efficiency of the Rankine cycle.
        turbine_work (float): The work done by the turbine in the Rankine cycle.
        pump_work (float): The work done by the pump in the Rankine cycle.
        heat_added (float): The heat added to the Rankine cycle.

    Methods:
        __init__: Initializes a Rankine cycle instance with specified parameters.
        calc_states: Calculates the steam properties at various states of the Rankine cycle.
        calc_efficiency: Calculates the efficiency of the Rankine cycle.
        print_summary: Prints a summary of the Rankine cycle.
