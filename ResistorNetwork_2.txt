# A resistor network is made of Resistors, Voltage Sources, Nodes and Loops
# Nodes are given a unique name of one letter
# Resistors are named by the nodes they connect arranged in alphabetical order.  If the current direction and traversal
#      direction across a resistor is the same, the voltage decreases.  If the traversal direction and current direction
#      are opposite, the voltage increases.
# Voltage sources are named by the nodes they connect arranged in alphabetical order.  The voltage source value
#      is in reference to the direction of the nodes (i.e., when traversing a loop in alphabetical order the voltage
#      increases and when traversing the opposite direction, the voltage decreases)
#this had been modifed by irvin to fit the new circuit, adding an addtional lopp and 2 nodes
